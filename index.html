                Over the summer of 2023, I become inspired through a series by
                Youtuber Sebastian Lague where he explores how computer logic
                and memory operate, starting from gates and latches to ALUs.
                These videos are by far the best resource that I've ever found
                explaining these fundamentals, I would recommend to anyone who's
                interested or are studying the subject. He also has a cool cat.

                Surprised by how easy it is to make a basic ALU, I decided to
                start replicating it in Minecraft. The game as a pseudo
                electronics system that lets you build all the logic gates you
                need to make a complete computer. Starting from a D latch and a
                1 bit full adder, I eventually worked my way to a full 8 bit
                adder.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here, you can see that both Register A and B have 00000100 (4),
              the circuit is adding and so the output is 00001000 (8).
            </p>
            <p>The parity flag is on meaning that the value is even.</p>
            <p>
              Eventually I became interested in replicating this on a breadboard
              and watched around Ben Eater's youtube series on it.
            </p>

            <div class="column">
              <p>
                In this 44 part series, Ben goes over the design and
                construction of an 8 bit processor on breadboards. Aquiring all
                the equipment would be expensive and a long endeavour.
                Nevertheless, I still was inspired by the idea of being able to
                design my own cpu. I started looking around the internet about
                CPU design, knowing virtually nothing about it. I stumbled upon
                a blog by Ken Shirriff on his project on reverse engineering the
                Intel 8008 chip. Seeing a real chip implement a similar kind of
                ALU, it made the prospect of doing it all myself even more real.

            <p>
              Another video that gave me insight to the design process was jdh's
              video: I designed my own 8-bit computer just to play PONG.

                Seeing how he went from a plain text file with the specification
                to a full working simulation (he later ended up doing on a
                breadboard), gave me the confidence to start throwing together
                something myself. My initial ideas were pretty dodgy and often
                fell apart after some critical thinking, but I was enjoying the
                process nonetheless.

              Seeing as building a whole breadboard computer would take up too
              much space, time and money, I figured that I would try the
              software that I had seen on the university computers: Logisim.

              A and B are the 2 numbers that you want to add together; Ci is the
              carry in; Y is the output; Co is the carry out.

            <p>
              This is an 8 bit ALU capable of adding, subtracting and comparing.
              Currently it is adding 64 + 64 and is outputting 128 (80 in
              hexadecimal).
            </p>
            <p>
              Op is the Op Code; A is the A register input; B is the B register
              input; Ci is the carry in; O is the overflow flag; Y is the
              output; Co is the carry out flag.

              This is the bottom half of the ALU and shows the logic for each of
              the flags.
            </p>
            <p>
              Z is the zero flag and denotes whether or not the value is zero. G
              is the greater than flag and denotes whether or not A is greater
              than B (given a comparison operation). Finally, L is the lesser
              than flag and denotes whether or not A is less than B (given a
              comparison operation).

              <p>
                Since the first 4 bits are reserved for instructions and the
                last 4 bits are reserved for addresses, I only have 16
                instructions to play with. This means I had to cut off a lot of
                instructions that are normally seen on a CPU to maintain this
                very simple system. Normally, more bits are used for an
                instruction and the target address is simply stored in the next
                memory. However, since I want to make this as simple as
                possible, I will have it all at once.

              This is mostly my project so far, I will write about updates over
              time.
